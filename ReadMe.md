# "Landing Page Author" By "Samiha Amroune" :blush:

This project is proposed by **Udacity** for **Front End Web Developer** students As 2end project.

This project requires us to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## The subject of the project

**Motivational phrases**, each of us needs in some difficult stages that he is going through, whether at work or study or any field and activity to be frustrated, sad or feeling hopeless, he needs to listen to phrases that motivate him not to give up and try again and pursue success as a main goal, so I collected some of them in This project is to encourage each of us to move forward and not back down, no matter the obstacles.

## Project files:

The blog contains 3 folders and 2 files:

- First folder "css":
    * contains 2 files:
        1. **all.min.css**: I use it for Font Awsome.
        2. **style.css**: the style of the page.
- Second folder **"images"** :
    * contains all images that i used in the page.
- Third folder **js**:
    * contains one file **"app.js"** wich Contains page interaction codes.

- **index.html** : Front page structure and interface.
-**ReadMe.md**: This is what you see now :blush: :wink:

## Expected from project:

* **Interface and Architecture:**

1. All features are usable across modern desktop :computer: , tablet, and phone browsers :iphone: . :ok_hand:
2. Styling has been added for active states. :ok_hand:
3.  There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page. (There 5 sections) :ok_hand:

* **Landing Page Behavior:**

1. Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. :ok_hand:
2. It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page. :ok_hand:
3. When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section. :ok_hand:

* **As suggested**:
1. Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport. :ok_hand:
2. Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load). :ok_hand:
    Hint: setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling. :watch: :ok_hand:
3. Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page. :top: :ok_hand:
4. Update/change the design/content. :ok_hand:
5. Make sections collapsible. (double click on the section button to make it collapsible) :scroll: :ok_hand:
